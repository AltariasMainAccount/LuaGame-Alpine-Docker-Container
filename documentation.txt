files:

- main.lua (main function file, is the file that gets used most)
- assets.lua (contains the textures of the game, can be used to make texture packs)
- functions.lua (contains all the functions and variables)
- hc.lua (contains all the hardcoded things (aka defaults, itemnames, enemies))

ideas:

- sequencer item (drains your HP, making the game harder)
- hardcore mode (forces the sequencer item onto you on start, enemies are stronger)
- baby mode (after every fight, heavy weapons guy will call you baby)

dum fuk juice:

- questionable slap: you slap someone with an organ of questionable choices and instantly perish afterwards
